GOALS
-Reliable, persistent socket connections
-Connections don't die randomly
-Server detects closed connections (heartbeat?) and closes these sockets
-Server can post/accept posts

TODO:
-Recieve json properly as http:post, right now I get undefined on the front always
-Figure out socket hash - can I do socket2id? or can I get the associated id on socket end? Why does the socket object get overwritten?
-Heartbeat (have an example, get it working)
